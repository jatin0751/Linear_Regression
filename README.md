# Linear Regression Case Study
> We are required to model the demand for shared bikes with the available independent variables. It will be used by the management to understand how exactly the demands vary with different features. They can accordingly manipulate the business strategy to meet the demand levels and meet the customer's expectations. Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the demand dynamics of a new market.

## General Information
- A bike-sharing system is a service in which bikes are made available for shared use to individuals on a short term basis for a price or free. Many bike share systems allow people to borrow a bike from a "dock" which is usually computer-controlled wherein the user enters the payment information, and the system unlocks it. This bike can then be returned to another dock belonging to the same system
- In such an attempt, BoomBikes aspires to understand the demand for shared bikes among the people after this ongoing quarantine situation ends across the nation due to Covid-19. They have planned this to prepare themselves to cater to the people's needs once the situation gets better all around and stand out from other service providers and make huge profits.
- The data set that is used in this project is day.csv file

## Conclusions
- As per our final Model, the top 3 predictor variables that influences the bike booking are: 
- Temperature(temp) : A coefficient value of '0.5136' indicated that a unit increase in temp variable increases the bike hire numbers by 0.5136 units. 
- Weather Situation 3(weathersit_3) : A coefficient value of '-0.2897' indicated that w.r.t to Weathersit1, a unit increase in Weathersit3 variable decreases the bike hire numbers by 0.2897 units.
- Year:(yr) : A coefficient value of '0.2343' indicated that a unit increase in yr variable increases the bike hire numbers by 0.2343 units.
